During her undergraduate work Sarah primarily studied environmental policy and sustainable development, where she discovered a passion for food systems. Then, a summer spent comparatively studying coastal sustainability challenges in Southeast Asia and New England introduced Sarah to seafood sustainability, science-based fisheries management, and sustainable aquaculture practices. Currently in her first year of graduate school, Sarah hopes to merge her interests in food and coastal sustainability.\nHere is a link to my Resume.\n\n\n\n",
