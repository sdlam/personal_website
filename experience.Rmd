During her undergraduate work Sarah primarily studied environmental policy and sustainable development, where she discovered a passion for food systems. Then, a summer spent comparatively studying coastal sustainability challenges in Southeast Asia and New England indroduced Sarah to seafood sustainability, science-based fisheries management, and sustainable aquaculture practices. Currenlty in her first year of graduate school, Sarah hopes to merge her interests in food sand coastal sustainability.
